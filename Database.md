# Primary key

    The primary key is a unique identifer for each record in the table
    Each table should have a primary key
    Cannot be changed
    
- Each table can have more than one primary key (composite key) i.e Order NO. & Order Line NO.
- it can be an attribute that is guaranteed to be unique, or it is generated by the DBMS (DataBase Management System)
- The DBMS will enforce the uniqueness of teh primary key stopping any record to be repeated in the table
